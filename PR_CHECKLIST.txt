                    PR CREATION CHECKLIST - READY FOR SUBMISSION
================================================================================

PR METADATA
-----------
Title:     Build Fixes: Module Boundaries, Includes, Deterministic Packaging
Source:    fix/build-breakers
Target:    integration/all-issues
Commits:   16 commits (since checkpoint wip/build-fix-checkpoint)
Files:     16 changed (all source/scripts/docs, no build artifacts)
Body:      PR_BODY.md (prepared and committed)


VALIDATION RESULTS
------------------
✅ Workspace Clean
   • git clean -xdf executed
   • Stale untracked headers removed
   • No build artifacts (verified: 0 .exe, 0 .pdb)
   • No trash directories (HostProject, Intermediate, Saved all absent)

✅ Packaging Pipeline
   • Raw build stage: SUCCESS
   • Filter/robocopy stage: SUCCESS (42 files in dist)
   • Binary stripping: 2 .pdb files removed
   • All validation gates PASSED

✅ Code Quality
   • Include paths: 9 files updated to namespaced pattern
   • Module boundaries: 1 UCLASS in runtime, 0 in editor (verified)
   • No duplicate type definitions

✅ Documentation
   • BUILD_FIX_SUMMARY.md: Comprehensive (Phase 2 & 3)
   • PR_BODY.md: Proof blocks + architecture + review focus areas
   • Commit messages: Review-friendly with line references
   • ValidatePackage.ps1: CI gate script created and tested


PROOF BLOCKS (Ready to paste into PR)
-------------------------------------
✓ Clean packaging validation (.exe=0, .pdb=0, no trash dirs)
✓ Two-stage packaging architecture (raw + robocopy filter)
✓ Module boundary invariant (1 UCLASS def in runtime)
✓ Checkpoint reference (16 commits since tag)


VALIDATION CONTRACT
-------------------
File: Scripts/ValidatePackage.ps1
Status: PASSED
Purpose: CI integration gate to prevent regressions

Exit codes:
  0 = Validation passed
  1 = Forbidden binaries found (*.exe, *.pdb)
  2 = Forbidden directories found (HostProject, Intermediate, Saved)
  3 = Missing required files/folders

Test run output:
  • No .exe files ✓
  • No .pdb files ✓
  • HostProject absent ✓
  • Intermediate absent ✓
  • Saved absent ✓
  • Required files found ✓
  • Folder structure validated ✓
  • Total files: 42


REVIEW FOCUS AREAS (Add to PR for reviewers)
---------------------------------------------
1. Scripts/PackagePlugin.ps1
   - Robocopy switches correctness (/E /NP /NFL /NDL)
   - Allowlist/denylist coverage
   - Validation gates sufficiency

2. Include Path Standardization
   - Public header relocation impact
   - External consumer compatibility
   - All 9 files caught?

3. Runtime/Editor Boundary
   - UVrmMetadataAsset in runtime correct?
   - Editor module dependencies correct?
   - No circular dependencies?


MERGE PLAN
----------
Strategy: Keep commits as-is (they tell the story)

Commits to review in order:
  1. Module fixes (move UVrmMetadataAsset, consolidate enums)
  2. Include standardization (reorganize headers)
  3. Packaging refactor (two-stage with robocopy)
  4. Documentation updates

No squashing recommended unless maintainers prefer it.
If squashing needed: only squash "include reshuffles" into 1-2;
keep "packaging two-stage refactor" separate.


NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Copy PR_BODY.md content into GitHub PR body
2. Set reviewers as appropriate
3. Link to checkpoint tag: wip/build-fix-checkpoint
4. Consider adding CI job calling Scripts/ValidatePackage.ps1
